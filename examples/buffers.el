;;; Commentary:

;; This is an example of using BUI (Buffer User Interface) library.
;;
;; It shows how to use bui to display a list of buffers à la
;; `list-buffers' or `ibuffer'.
;;
;; To try it, load this file (for example, with "M-x load-file"), and
;; run "M-x buffers" command.  There you can mark several buffers (with
;; "m") and press "i" to display the info buffer; press "f f" to enable
;; filters, etc.  Press "h" to look at the "hint" (available keys).
